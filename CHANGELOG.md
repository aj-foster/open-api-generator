# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## 0.1.0-rc.0

**Breaking**: This is a major release.
  See the [migration guide](guides/migration.md) for more information.
**Add**: Plugin system for overriding the behavior of this library.
  See the [plugins guide](guides/plugins.md) for more information.
**Add**: Additional internal types to represent string variations, enums, etc.
**Fix**: Uniformly normalize names of operations and schemas.

### 0.0.7 (2023-06-07)

**Add**: `schema_use` option to add optional `use [Module]` statements within schemas.
**Add**: `operation_default_module` and `operation_use_tags` options for controlling the creation of operation modules (thanks [@xadhoom](https://github.com/xadhoom)!).
**Add**: New _Client Author Guide_ for assisting client library authors.
**Fix**: Allow empty/missing `tags` and `components` keys in the specification (thanks [@rubas](https://github.com/rubas)!).
**Fix**: Allow missing server variable object in the specification (thanks [@xadhoom](https://github.com/xadhoom)!).
**Fix**: Keep acronyms intact when naming operations (thanks [@feynmanliang](https://github.com/feynmanliang)!).

### 0.0.6 (2023-05-17)

* **Add**: New `extra_fields` option to allow library authors to create their own private fields on generated structs.
  The location and semantics of this option are likely to be changed in the future.
* **Fix**: Include `body` argument in `args` passed to the client.
  Clients may rely on this information (the values themselves, or the arity) for their operations, especially in testing situations.

### 0.0.5 (2023-05-16)

* **Fix**: Replace all non-alphanumeric characters when naming tagged operations.
* **Fix**: Handle nullable union types with no realizable non-null types.
  This case occurred in the GitHub spec (see [github/rest-api-description#2534](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/2534)).

### 0.0.4 (2023-05-10)

* **Add**: Add `call` information to client calls.
  This will allow specialized clients, like a test mock, to introspect the original calling function without the use of stack traces.
* **Fix**: Add missing type `:map` to `OpenAPI.Generator.Typing.t()`.
* **Fix**: Support `default` entry in responses object (thanks [@aej](https://github.com/aej)!).
* **Fix**: Strip spaces and repetitive dash/underscore/whitespace characters when naming operations (thanks [@feynmanliang](https://github.com/feynmanliang)!).

### 0.0.3 (2023-02-19)

* **Add**: Add `args` keyword list to client calls.
  This will allow specialized clients, like a test mock, to differentiate between static URL segments and dynamic path parameters.

### 0.0.2 (2023-02-17)

* **Add**: Support OpenAPI 3.1 `"null"` type
* **Add**: Support `type` field given as an array of primitive types
* **Fix**: Infer `map` type in more cases when `type` field is unspecified

### 0.0.1 (2023-01-05)

* **Initial Release**

_A highly-configurable code generator that combines ergonomics with maintainability._

---

[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) is a standard way to describe REST APIs on the web.
Anyone can create an OpenAPI description document that includes the available endpoints, expected request data, and possible responses.
For example, [GitHub](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description) maintains a comprehensive OpenAPI description for their services.

Generating code from an OpenAPI description can be relatively easy — this project [certainly isn't the first](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/elixir) — but there's a catch: API descriptions often don't translate into ergonomic code.
Most users of an API client library don't want to think about the difference between a `NullableRepository` and `Repository`, as in the OpenAPI 3.0 GitHub API description.
(They have the same fields, but one has `nullable: true`.)
Users just want to get back a `%Repository{}` or `nil`.

The goal of this library is to create **ergonomic** client libraries from OpenAPI descriptions.
At the same time, the changes made to the code are easily repeatable (fully automated) for the sake of maintainability.
Think: the friendliness of your favorite hand-crafted client library applied to the scale of large APIs.

> _See an example client library [here](https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-github)._

For more on how this is accomplished, see **Configuration** below and the [configuration guide](guides/configuration.md).


## Installation

This library is available on Hex.pm.
Add the dependency in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:oapi_generator, "0.1.0-rc.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then install the dependency using `mix deps.get`.


## Configuration

The real power of this library is in the available configuration.
Although the options are conceptually simple, they add up to a better user experience.

This project uses configuration profiles to allow multiple configurations with the same package.
To get started, create a profile called `default` in your configuration:

```elixir
config :oapi_generator, default: [
  output: [
    base_location: "lib/example",
    base_module: Example
  ]
]
```

This is the minimum viable configuration for most client libraries.
It will create modules namespaced with `Example.` and save files in `lib/example`.

Some the options supported by the generator out-of-the-box include:

* Ignoring schemas and operations
* Renaming schemas
* Grouping schemas into module namespaces
* Merging schemas to create a struct with multiple typespecs
* Writing schemas and operation modules to different locations
* Introducing additional schema fields
* Adding custom `use` statements to generated modules
* Overriding function return types

For more information, see the [configuration guide](guides/configuration.md).


## Plugins

If the available configuration isn't enough, client library authors can also reimplement portions of the code generator using _plugins_.
Most of the crucial parts of the processing and rendering of code are implemented as default callbacks for a behaviour.
These can be overridden for additional flexibility.
See the [plugins guide](guides/plugins.md) for additional information.


## Usage

Once the library is installed and configured, use `mix api.gen` with the name of the configuration profile and the OpenAPI description file(s):

```shell
mix api.gen default path/to/rest-api-description/spec.yaml
```

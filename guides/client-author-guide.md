# Client Author Guide

Unlike most packages on Hex.pm, the target audience for this project is _other library authors_, and not necessarily end-users.
While it is certainly possible for application developers to generate code directly in their Elixir apps, it's likely that most OpenAPI specifications will be consumed by a generic client library (like [oapi_github](https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-github)) instead.

As the author of a library with code generated from an OpenAPI description, it's important to establish a healthy relationship between your library and the spec.
For example, if your library is based on a specification that is updated often, you likely want to set a reasonable cadence (ex. monthly) for updating the generated code.
Otherwise, maintenance can become a burden very quickly.

Following are some recommendations for how to establish this relationship.

## Cadence

As mentioned above, some OpenAPI descriptions are updated often.
Before introducing API versioning, GitHub continuously updated its OpenAPI spec with both new endpoints and corrections for existing ones.
A library author could potentially release new versions every week in an attempt to keep up.
However, it's unlikely that real-time updates of the generated code is necessary.

Here are a few options for releasing updates to the generated code:

1. If the description updates often with new endpoints that consumers of your library are eager to use, a rapid or as-needed release cadence may be appropriate.
  This might mean creating a scheduled CI job that regularly re-generates the code based on the latest copy of the specification and opens a pull request with the changes.
  Or, it might mean encouraging users of the library to open an issue or pull request when they encounter an unsupported endpoint.

2. If the description updates often with fixes to the specification, then a periodic release cadence may be appropriate.
  This would help users of the library avoid issues while also reducing the maintenance burden.

3. If the description has well-versioned or occasional updates, the client may wish to "follow" the release cadence of the specification.
  In this case, the version of the description may play a central role in the client, and should likely be included as an `.api-version` file in the release.
  This makes it clear to users of the library what API version they can expect.

## Contributions

Some libraries will be best served by an as-needed update cadence.
In this case, simple guidelines around the contribution of generated code can make a big difference.

Here is an excerpt from the contribution guidelines for the GitHub client library that uses this generator:

> ### Updating the Generated Code
>
> If you intend to open a PR with updates to the generated code based on the latest GitHub OpenAPI description, please read carefully:
> 
> 1. Please use the latest commit from the [official repository](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description) at the time of your contribution.
> 2. Please use `descriptions-next/api.github.com/api.github.com.yaml` â€” **not** `descriptions` or a GitHub Enterprise release.
> 3. Use `mix api.gen default path/to/descriptions-next/api.github.com/api.github.com.yaml` to regenerate the code.
> 4. Please also change the `.api-version` file if appropriate.
> 5. Please include the commit SHA of the official repository in the description of your pull request.
> 6. Please do not make any other changes in the same PR (for example, changing this library's version).
>
> If you run into any unexpected issues while generating the code, please open an issue.
>
> Thank you for your help!

Although not all contributors will read this guidance, steps like this can make it much easier for you as a library author to simply merge the pull request and release a new version.

## Supplemental Specs

Despite best efforts, OpenAPI descriptions often don't cover all of the API endpoints available.
For example, although GitHub provides a nearly-comprehensive specification of hundreds of endpoints, there are ID-based endpoints like `/repositories/{id}` that are not publicly documented.
A library author may know this _a priori_ and wish to include these endpoints in the generated code.

For this case, it is recommended that the author **maintain a separate, supplemental OpenAPI description document** with just enough information to generate the additional code.
This (presumably small) supplemental description can be committed along with the client code while the official description remains separate.

  List global security advisories

  Lists all global security advisories that match the specified parameters. If no other parameters are defined, the request will return only GitHub-reviewed advisories that are not malware.

  By default, all responses will exclude advisories for malware, because malware are not standard vulnerabilities. To list advisories for malware, you must include the `type` parameter in your request, with the value `malware`. For more information about the different types of security advisories, see "[About the GitHub Advisory database](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database#about-types-of-security-advisories)."

  ## Options

    * `ghsa_id`: If specified, only advisories with this GHSA (GitHub Security Advisory) identifier will be returned.
    * `type`: If specified, only advisories of this type will be returned. By default, a request with no other parameters defined will only return reviewed advisories that are not malware.
    * `cve_id`: If specified, only advisories with this CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier will be returned.
    * `ecosystem`: If specified, only advisories for these ecosystems will be returned.
    * `severity`: If specified, only advisories with these severities will be returned.
    * `cwes`: If specified, only advisories with these Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) will be returned.
      
      Example: `cwes=79,284,22` or `cwes[]=79&cwes[]=284&cwes[]=22`
    * `is_withdrawn`: Whether to only return advisories that have been withdrawn.
    * `affects`: If specified, only return advisories that affect any of `package` or `package@version`. A maximum of 1000 packages can be specified.
      If the query parameter causes the URL to exceed the maximum URL length supported by your client, you must specify fewer packages.
      
      Example: `affects=package1,package2@1.0.0,package3@^2.0.0` or `affects[]=package1&affects[]=package2@1.0.0`
    * `published`: If specified, only return advisories that were published on a date or date range.
      
      For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."

      For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."

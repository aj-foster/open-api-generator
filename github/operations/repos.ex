  Add a repository collaborator

  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Best practices for using the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

  Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."

  For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:

  ```
  Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
  ```

  Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP method](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."

  The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [API](https://docs.github.com/rest/collaborators/invitations).

  **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**

  The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level changed.

  **Rate limits**

  You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

  Compare two commits

  Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections between repositories](https://docs.github.com/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."

  This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.
  - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.

  The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.

  When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.

  **Working with large comparisons**

  To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:

  - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
  - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

  For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

  **Signature verification object**

  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object includes the following fields:

  | Name | Type | Description |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
  | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
  | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
  | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

  | Value | Description |
  | ----- | ----------- |
  | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
  | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
  | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
  | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
  | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
  | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
  | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
  | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
  | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
  | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
  | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
  | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
  | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

  ## Options

    * `page`: The page number of the results to fetch. For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
    * `per_page`: The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

  Create a deployment

  Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.

  The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
  before we merge a pull request.

  The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
  multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
  makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.

  The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
  the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
  the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
  return a failure response.

  By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
  state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
  specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
  not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

  The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
  field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

  The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
  be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
  application with debugging enabled.

  Merged branch response:

  You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
  a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
  *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
  *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
  *   There are no merge conflicts

  If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
  response.

  Merge conflict response:

  This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
  be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.

  Failed commit status checks:

  This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
  status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

  When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can use this endpoint to disable required signed commits on a branch. You must enable branch protection to require signed commits.

  Delete a deployment

  If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment regardless of its status. If the repository has more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active deployment.

  To set a deployment as inactive, you must:

  *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
  *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.

  For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/statuses#create-a-deployment-status)."

  Delete a file

  Deletes a file in a repository.

  You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the author.

  The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.

  You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.

  **Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file contents](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

  Get repository permissions for a user

  Checks the repository permission of a collaborator. The possible repository
  permissions are `admin`, `write`, `read`, and `none`.

  *Note*: The `permission` attribute provides the legacy base roles of `admin`, `write`, `read`, and `none`, where the
  `maintain` role is mapped to `write` and the `triage` role is mapped to `read`. To determine the role assigned to the
  collaborator, see the `role_name` attribute, which will provide the full role name, including custom roles. The
  `permissions` hash can also be used to determine which base level of access the collaborator has to the repository.

  Get a commit

  Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.

  **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff and the default JSON media type is requested, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)." Pagination query parameters are not supported for these media types.

  - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.
  - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.
  - **`application/vnd.github.sha`**: Returns the commit's SHA-1 hash. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.

  **Signature verification object**

  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

  | Name | Type | Description |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
  | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
  | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
  | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

  | Value | Description |
  | ----- | ----------- |
  | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
  | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
  | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
  | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
  | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
  | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
  | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
  | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
  | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
  | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
  | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
  | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
  | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

  Get repository content

  Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).
  - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.

  If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".

  If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.

  If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

  **Notes**:

  - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
  - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve
  more files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
  - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
  - If the requested file's size is:
    - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
    - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
  string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
    - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

  | Value | Description |
  | ----- | ----------- |
  | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
  | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
  | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
  | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
  | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
  | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
  | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
  | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
  | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
  | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
  | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
  | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
  | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

  Remove a repository collaborator

  Removes a collaborator from a repository.

  To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must either be an administrator of the repository or target themselves for removal.

  This endpoint also:
  - Cancels any outstanding invitations
  - Unasigns the user from any issues
  - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization repositories.
  - Unstars the repository
  - Updates access permissions to packages

  Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
   - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
   - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
   - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

  **Note**: A user can still have access to the repository through organization permissions like base repository permissions.

  Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates might take some extra time to complete in the background.

  Request a GitHub Pages build

  You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.

  Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first completes.

  Upload a release asset

  This endpoint makes use of a [Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
  the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.

  You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.

  Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example: 

  `application/zip`

  GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
  you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.

  When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.

  **Notes:**
  *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"
  endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
  *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release). 
  *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

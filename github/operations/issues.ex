  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
  reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
  request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.

  ## Options

    * `filter`: Indicates which sorts of issues to return. `assigned` means issues assigned to you. `created` means issues created by you. `mentioned` means issues mentioning you. `subscribed` means issues you're subscribed to updates for. `all` or `repos` means all issues you can see, regardless of participation or creation.
    * `state`: Indicates the state of the issues to return.
    * `labels`: A list of comma separated label names. Example: `bug,ui,@high`
    * `sort`: What to sort results by.
    * `direction`: The direction to sort the results by.

    * `collab`
    * `orgs`
    * `owned`
    * `pulls`
    * `per_page`: The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

  List issues in an organization assigned to the authenticated user.

  **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
  reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
  the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
  request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.

  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.

  ## Options

    * `filter`: Indicates which sorts of issues to return. `assigned` means issues assigned to you. `created` means issues created by you. `mentioned` means issues mentioning you. `subscribed` means issues you're subscribed to updates for. `all` or `repos` means all issues you can see, regardless of participation or creation.
    * `state`: Indicates the state of the issues to return.
    * `labels`: A list of comma separated label names. Example: `bug,ui,@high`
    * `sort`: What to sort results by.

  Update an issue comment

  You can use the REST API to update comments on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
